    "# Getis Ord Gi* Example\n",
    "Getis  and Ord's Gi and Gi* statistics are popular statistical approaches for finding statistically significant hot and cold spots across space. It compares the value of some numerical variable of a spatial record with those of the neighboring records. The nature of these neighborhoods is controlled by the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will use the Gi* statistic on the Overture places data to identify regions of high and lower \"density\". For this exercises we assume that more places data indicates higher density.\n"

    "## Configuration\n",
    "We configure here the size of the neighborhood, the region in which we want to generate statistics, and the resolution of the grid cells we will generate. Today we will perform this exercise for the region around Seattle and Bellevue, Washington. A good analysis here should reveal the urban core of Seattle and downtowns of Bellevue, Redmond, Kirkland, and Issaquah.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a larger cluster we can set region to None and generate this data for the entire world.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the neighbor radius, we want a value that gives each cell a substantial number of neighbors (maybe at least 10), but does not allow the degree of density in downtown Seattle to obscure Issaquah's downtown. It's about finding a balance between generating an accurate and powerful statistic and achieving sufficiently local results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the zoom level, we want cells that are small enough to resolve the phenomena we are searching for but large enough such that each cell's statistic is not due to randomness in the spatial distribution of places. Imagine cells that are so small that they are could be contained by the roadway. Each cell might show only 1 or 0 places, which is not going to reveal the trends we are looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting these parameters can require some trial and error, and perhaps domain knowledge. We will show some of that selection process in this notebook.\n"
