    "# Geospatial ETL with Wherobots and Databricks Unity Catalog\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds a geospatial ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Wherobots and Databricks Unity Catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a weather forecast dataset, you will:\n",
    "* **Read** a Managed Delta table from Unity Catalog.\n",
    "* **Transform** coordinates into spatial `POINT` geometries.\n",
    "* **Enrich** the data by calculating each forecast's proximity to Tokyo to create a new threat feature.\n",
    "* **Write** the results back to a new external Delta table, dropping the geometry column as it is not natively supported by Databricks.\n",
    "    * **Note:** This example writes to an External Delta table because Databricks prevents external platforms like Wherobots from writing to Managed tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides the building blocks for you to perform more complex spatial analysis and processing on your own data in Wherobots.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Proximity Analysis: Calculate Distances to Key Locations\n",

    "##### A Practical Example\n",
    "Imagine your business has major operations or supply chain dependencies in the **Tokyo metropolitan area**, where severe weather can disrupt logistics and public safety. Your raw data contains thousands of forecasts across the region but lacks the context of which ones pose a direct threat to the city.\n",

    "\n",
    "> \"Show me cities with **wind gusts over 40 mph** or **heavy precipitation** within a **500-kilometer radius** of Tokyo.\"\n",
    "\n",
