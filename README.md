## Contributing

When raising a PR, make sure to run pre-commit hooks to the notebooks are cleaned and the README is updated.

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Sometimes this will fail and update your notebooks or the README file. Generally, you can rerun the command and it
will pass as the pre-commit hooks will fix the issues it finds.
