In this notebook we will demostrate how to perform k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) joins in WherobotsDB.
A geospatial k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) join is a specialized form of the kNN join that specifically deals with geospatial data. This method involves identifying the k-nearest neighbors for a given spatial point or region based on geographic proximity, typically using spatial coordinates and a suitable distance metric like Euclidean or great-circle distance.

There are two types of kNN joins supported in WherobotsDB:

- **Approximate kNN Join**: The approximate k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm utilizes an approximation method to map and distribute multidimensional data into a single dimension while maintaining some degree of locality. This approach allows for the efficient generation of approximate k-Nearest Neighbors for each geometry in the query dataset. 
- **Exact kNN Join**: The exact k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm begins by partitioning the dataset to maintain spatial locality. It then constructs an efficient structure over another dataset to quickly find accurate kNN matches. By combining local results, the algorithm delivers the complete kNN join for both datasets.

For a more in-depth explanation, including additional examples, API details, and usage guidelines, please refer to the documentation [here](https://docs.wherobots.com/latest/references/wherobotsdb/vector-data/NearestNeighbourSearching/) or check out our detailed tech blog [here](https://wherobots.com/introducing-knn-join-for-wherobots-and-apache-sedona/).

## Initial Configuration


```python
from sedona.spark import *

config = SedonaContext.builder().getOrCreate()
sedona = SedonaContext.create(config)

```

# Use Case Example

In this use case, the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) join is applied to match places with nearby flights. The Queries table contains the locations of Overture Maps [places](https://docs.overturemaps.org/guides/places/), such as schools, businesses, hospitals, religious organizations, landmarks, and mountain peak, while the Objects table holds the locations of flights. The goal is to find which flights are closest to each place, which can be crucial for making real-time decisions in air traffic management and ensuring flight safety.

### Queries Table: Places

This table contains the objects for which you want to find the nearest neighbors.

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import col
from pyspark.sql.functions import monotonically_increasing_id, col

# load data
df_queries = sedona.table("wherobots_open_data.overture_maps_foundation.places_place")
df_queries = df_queries.withColumn("id", monotonically_increasing_id())
df_queries = df_queries.filter(f"ST_Contains(ST_GeomFromWKT('{spatial_filter}'), geometry) = true")

df_queries = df_queries.repartition(100)

df_queries.cache()

df_queries.createOrReplaceTempView("queries")

print(df_queries.rdd.getNumPartitions())
print(df_queries.count())

```

### Objects Table: Flights

This table contains the objects that are potential neighbors to the objects in the Queries table.


```python
# Load objects table
df_objects = sedona.read.format("geoparquet").load("s3a://wherobots-examples/data/examples/flights/2024_s2.parquet")
df_objects = df_objects.filter(f"ST_Contains(ST_GeomFromWKT('{spatial_filter}'), geometry) = true")
df_objects = df_objects.repartition(800)

df_objects.cache()

df_objects.createOrReplaceTempView("objects")

print(df_objects.rdd.getNumPartitions())
print(df_objects.count())

```

## Run KNN Join

The spatial SQL below demonstrates the new SQL syntax for performing KNN joins on the Wherobots platform.

```python
%%time

df_knn_join = sedona.sql("""
SELECT
    QUERIES.GEOMETRY AS QUERIES_GEOM,
    QUERIES.ID AS QID,
    OBJECTS.GEOMETRY AS OBJECTS_GEOM,
    ST_DISTANCESPHERE(QUERIES.GEOMETRY, OBJECTS.GEOMETRY) AS DISTANCE,
    ST_MAKELINE(QUERIES.GEOMETRY, OBJECTS.GEOMETRY) AS LINE
FROM QUERIES
JOIN OBJECTS ON ST_KNN(QUERIES.GEOMETRY, OBJECTS.GEOMETRY, 4, FALSE)
""")

# cache for further queries and visualization
df_knn_join.cache()

total_count = df_knn_join.count()
print(total_count)

```

```python
# Select N unique QID rows
df_unique_qid = df_knn_join.dropDuplicates(["QUERIES_GEOM"])

# Perform an inner join to get all rows from join_df that have QIDs in unique_qid_df
df_related_rows = df_knn_join.join(df_unique_qid, on="QID", how="inner").select(df_knn_join["*"])

df_unique_qid.cache()
df_related_rows.cache()

df_related_rows.count()
```

```python
# create map for the results
map_view = SedonaKepler.create_map(df_unique_qid.select('QUERIES_GEOM'), name="PLACES")
SedonaKepler.add_df(map_view, df=df_related_rows.select('OBJECTS_GEOM', 'DISTANCE').withColumnRenamed("OBJECTS_GEOM", "geometry"), name="FLIGHTS")
SedonaKepler.add_df(map_view, df=df_related_rows.select('LINE', 'DISTANCE').withColumnRenamed("LINE", "geometry"), name="KNN LINES")

# show the map
map_view
```
