This notebook will guide you through detecting sidewalks from aerial imagery, using Wherobots RasterFlow and the Tile2Net model. You will gain a hands-on understanding of how to run models like Tile2Net on your selected area of interest, vectorize the model outputs, and work with those vectors in WherobotsDB.

### Tile2Net

The [Tile2Net](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/tile2net)<sup>1</sup> model is an open source segmentation model that can detect sidewalks and other pathways from very high resolution imagery.

This model predicts 4 classes: 
- background
- road
- sidewalk
- crosswalk  

It was trained on ~19cm aerial imagery from USGS for Cambridge, Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Washington DC.  We will demonstrate results using 30cm resolution data from the [National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP)](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/usgs-eros-archive-aerial-photography-national-agriculture-imagery-program-naip).

## Selecting an Area of Interest (AOI)
To start, we will choose an Area of Interest (AOI) for our analysis. Tile2Net was trained on select geographies in the Northeastern United States. So we will pick a location in that geographic region that wasn't in the training data and where these is recent 30cm resolution NAIP data: College Park, Maryland.

The National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) provides aerial imagery for the United States, capturing high-resolution images during the agricultural growing seasons. The 2023 NAIP dataset offers 30cm resolution imagery in certain regions, see [this map](https://esri.maps.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?webmap=6cc0dcb225de4cb8aaa23c6a9cb59db8) for more details.


```python
import wkls
import geopandas as gpd
import os

# Generate a geometry for College Park, Maryland using Well-Known Locations (https://github.com/wherobots/wkls)
# NOTE: later in the notebook we fix an area to inspect assuming you ran on College Park. If you change the location here
# you will need to update the visualization area in "Visualize a subset of the model outputs"
gdf = gpd.read_file(wkls.us.md.collegepark.geojson())

# Save the geometry to a parquet file in the user's S3 path
aoi_path = os.getenv("USER_S3_PATH") + "collegepark.parquet"
gdf.to_parquet(aoi_path)
```

## Initializing the RasterFlow client

```python
from datetime import datetime

from rasterflow_remote import RasterflowClient

from rasterflow_remote.data_models import (
    ModelRecipes, 
    VectorizeMethodEnum
)

rf_client = RasterflowClient()
```

## Running a model

RasterFlow has pre-defined workflows to simplify orchestration of the processing steps for model inference.  These steps include:
* Ingesting imagery for the specified Area of Interest (AOI)
* Generating a seamless image from multiple image tiles (a mosaic) 
* Running inference with the selected model

The output is a Zarr store of the model outputs.

Note: This step will take approximately 30 minutes to complete.

```python
model_outputs = rf_client.build_and_predict_mosaic_recipe(
    # Path to our AOI in GeoParquet or GeoJSON format
    aoi = aoi_path,

    # Date range for imagery to be used by the model
    start = datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    end = datetime(2024, 1, 1),

    # Coordinate Reference System EPSG code for the output mosaic   
    crs_epsg = 3857,

    # The model recipe to be used for inference (Tile2Net in this case)
    model_recipe = ModelRecipes.TILE_2_NET,
)

print(model_outputs)
```

## Visualize a subset of the model outputs
The raster outputs from the model for this AOI are approximately 20GB.  We can choose a small subset of the data around the University of Maryland campus and use hvplot to visualize the model outputs.

```python
# Import libraries for visualization and coordinate transformation
import hvplot.xarray
import xarray as xr
import s3fs 
import zarr
from pyproj import Transformer
from holoviews.element.tiles import EsriImagery 

# Open the Zarr store
fs = s3fs.S3FileSystem(profile="default", asynchronous=True)
zstore = zarr.storage.FsspecStore(fs, path=model_outputs[5:])
ds = xr.open_zarr(zstore)

# Create a transformer to convert from lat/lon to meters
transformer = Transformer.from_crs("EPSG:4326", "EPSG:3857", always_xy=True)

# Transform bounding box coordinates from lat/lon to meters
min_lon = -76.95  
max_lon = -76.93   
min_lat = 38.98  
max_lat = 38.995

(min_x, max_x), (min_y, max_y) = transformer.transform(
    [min_lon, max_lon], 
    [min_lat, max_lat]
)

# Select the height variable and slice the dataset to the bounding box
# y=slice(max_y, min_y) handles the standard "North-to-South" image orientation
ds_subset = ds.sel(band="sidewalk",
    x=slice(min_x, max_x), 
    y=slice(max_y, min_y) 
)

# Select the first time step and extract the variables array
arr_subset = ds_subset.isel(time=0)["variables"]

# Create a base map layer using Esri satellite imagery
base_map = EsriImagery()

# Create an overlay layer from the model outputs with hvplot
output_layer = arr_subset.hvplot(
    x = "x",
    y = "y",
    geo = True,           # Enable geographic plotting
    dynamic = True,       # Enable dynamic rendering for interactivity
    rasterize = True,     # Use datashader for efficient rendering of large datasets
    cmap = "viridis",     # Color map for visualization
    aspect = "equal",     # Maintain equal aspect ratio
    title = "Tile2Net Model Outputs" 
).opts(
    width = 600, 
    height = 600,
    alpha = .7           # Set transparency to see the base map underneath
)

# Combine the base map and output layer
final_plot = base_map * output_layer
final_plot
```

## Vectorize the raster model outputs
The output for the Tile2Net model is a raster with four classes: background, road, sidewalk, crosswalk.  

We can run a seperate flow to convert the roads, sidewalks and crosswalks into vector geometries, based on the confidence threshold.  Converting these results to geometries allows us to more easily post process the results or join the resuilts with other vector data.

```python
# Determine the classes that are predicted by the model
model_features = xr.open_zarr(zstore)['band'].data.tolist()

# Only vectorize the 'sidewalk' and 'crosswalk' classes 
relevant_features = ['sidewalk', 'crosswalk']   
vector_features = [f for f in model_features if f in relevant_features]
```

```python
# Note: this should take about 5 minutes to complete
vectorized_results = rf_client.vectorize_mosaic(
        store = model_outputs,
        features = vector_features,
        threshold = 0.05,
        vectorize_method = VectorizeMethodEnum.SEMANTIC_SEGMENTATION_RASTERIO,
        vectorize_config={"stats": True, "medial_skeletonize": False}
    )

print(vectorized_results)
```

## Save the vectorized results to the catalog
We can store these vectorized outputs in the catalog by using WherobotsDB to persist the GeoParquet results.

```python
from sedona.spark import *
import pyspark.sql.functions as f
from pyspark.sql.functions import expr

config = SedonaContext.builder().getOrCreate()
sedona = SedonaContext.create(config)
```

```python
sedona.sql("CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS org_catalog.tile2net_db")

df = sedona.read.format("geoparquet").load(vectorized_results)
df = df.withColumnRenamed("label", "layer")
df.writeTo("org_catalog.tile2net_db.tile2net_vectorized").createOrReplace()
```

## Visualize the vectorized results

To visualize the vectorized results, we will filter out results with a score lower than 0.2. This threshold was determined through observation to strike a balance: it eliminates obvious noise without being overly aggressive, ensuring that we don't accidentally filter out too many relevant results.

Gaps in prediction for Tile2net are likely due to it being used with lower resolution imagery (30cm resolution) than what it was trained on (19cm resolution), as well as changes in geographic context, and occlusion from trees over the pathways.

```python
df = df.filter("score_mean > 0.2")
df_filtered = df.withColumn(
    "area_m2",
    expr("ST_AreaSpheroid(geometry)")
).filter("area_m2 > 1000")
```

```python
from sedona.spark.maps.SedonaKepler import SedonaKepler
map = SedonaKepler.create_map(df=df_filtered, name="Vectorized results")
map
```

## Generate PM Tiles for visualization
To improve visualization performance of a large number of geometries, we can use Wherobots built-in high performance PM tile generator.

```python
from wherobots import vtiles

full_tiles_path = os.getenv("USER_S3_PATH") + "tiles.pmtiles"
vtiles.generate_pmtiles(df_filtered, full_tiles_path)
```

```python
vtiles.show_pmtiles(full_tiles_path)
```
