    "This section explains how the following query calculates the average elevation of New York City buildings using a 1-ft Central Park DEM\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "buildings_elevation = sedona.sql(f'''\n",
    "with a as (\n",
    "select\n",

    "\n",
    "select * from a where elevation > 0\n",
    "''')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìä Key Steps and Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Inputs\n",
    "- **`elevation`**: A 1-ft resolution DEM of Central Park, providing high-precision elevation data.\n",
    "- **`buildings`**: A dataset of all buildings in New York City, including geometry (`geom`) and property address (`PROP_ADDR`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Coordinate Transformation\n",
    "- The building geometries are transformed from EPSG:4326 (geographic coordinates) to EPSG:2263 (New York State Plane coordinates) using `st_transform`. This ensures compatibility with the DEM raster.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Zonal Statistics Calculation\n",
    "- **`RS_ZonalStats`** computes the mean elevation for each building geometry based on the DEM:\n",
    "  - **Raster Input**: `elevation.rast` (DEM raster file).\n",
    "  - **Vector Geometry**: Transformed building geometries.\n",
    "  - **Band**: The first band of the raster is used.\n",
    "  - **Statistic**: `mean` calculates the average elevation within the building footprint.\n",
    "  - **Ignore NoData**: `true` ensures invalid or missing data in the raster is excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Spatial Join\n",
    "- **`RS_Intersects`** ensures only buildings intersecting the DEM raster are included in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Filtering Results**\n",
    "- The query filters out buildings with non-positive elevation values using `where elevation > 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Aggregation\n",
    "- Elevation values are grouped by building address (`PROP_ADDR`) and geometry to compute the average elevation for each unique building.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìã Output\n",
    "The resulting DataFrame, `buildings_elevation`, contains:\n",
    "- **`name`**: The property address of the building.\n",
    "- **`geom`**: The building geometry.\n",
    "- **`elevation`**: The average elevation of the building footprint in feet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üåü Practical Use\n",
    "This analysis combines raster (DEM) and vector (building footprints) data to derive meaningful insights about urban infrastructure. For example, it can be used for:\n",
    "- Identifying buildings at risk of flooding based on elevation.\n",
    "- Urban planning and construction in areas with varying terrain.\n",
    "- Environmental impact studies within Central Park and surrounding areas.\n"

    "You‚Äôve learned how to:\n",
    "- Integrate raster and vector data for advanced geospatial analysis.\n",
    "- Perform zonal statistics to derive meaningful insights from elevation and temperature datasets.\n",
    "- Use Apache Sedona SQL to manipulate and query spatial data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üõ†Ô∏è Experiment with Different Data Sources\n",
    "- Use additional raster datasets, such as vegetation indices or precipitation maps, to enhance your analysis.\n",
    "- Incorporate demographic or socioeconomic vector datasets to explore spatial relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Did you know that Wherobots allows you to run [NDVI analysis](https://docs.wherobots.com/latest/api/wherobots-compute/sql/Raster-map-algebra/?h=ndvi#ndvi) and you can use [Overture Maps data](https://docs.wherobots.com/latest/tutorials/opendata/introduction/?h=overture#open-data-catalogs) from Wherobots DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîç Try Advanced Apache Sedona Features\n",
    "- Explore Sedona‚Äôs spatial join capabilities to analyze relationships between multiple vector datasets.\n",
    "- Use Sedona‚Äôs advanced functions, like `ST_Buffer` or `ST_Within`, for proximity and containment analysis.\n",

    "In the next notebook, we'll dive deeper into the best practices for efficiently loading raster and vector data into DataFrames for advanced geospatial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next notebook will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "* üåê **Optimizing Vector Dataframes**\n",
    "  - Step-by-step guides for loading vector data types into Apache Sedona DataFrames.\n",
    "  - Steps on how to ensure your dataframes are performant in Wherobots.\n",
    "\n",
    "* üó∫Ô∏è **Optimizing Raster Data**\n",
    "  - Learn how to use Out-of-Database Rasters stored in remote cloud storage buckets (e.g., AWS Open Earth Data).\n",
    "  - You'll complete the following steps:\n",
    "    1. Create a new raster dataset from a remote file.\n",
    "    2. Explode and divide your Out-DB raster into tiles to optimize query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* üõ†Ô∏è **Preparing for Spatial Joins**\n",
    "  - We‚Äôll cover the best strategies for combining raster and vector datasets to answer complex geospatial questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this foundation, you‚Äôll be fully equipped to manage and query large-scale spatial datasets in Wherobots."
