    "A geospatial k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) join is a specialized form of the kNN join that specifically deals with geospatial data. This method involves identifying the k-nearest neighbors for a given spatial point or region based on geographic proximity, typically using spatial coordinates and a suitable distance metric like Euclidean or great-circle distance.\n",

    "**Approximate kNN Join**\n",
    "\n",
    "The approximate k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm utilizes an approximation method to map and distribute multidimensional data into a single dimension while maintaining some degree of locality. This approach allows for the efficient generation of approximate k-Nearest Neighbors for each geometry in the query dataset. \n",

    "The exact k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm begins by partitioning the dataset to maintain spatial locality. It then constructs an efficient structure over another dataset to quickly find accurate kNN matches. By combining local results, the algorithm delivers the complete kNN join for both datasets.\n",

    "In this use case, the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) join is applied to match places with nearby flights. The Queries table contains the locations of Overture Maps [places](https://docs.overturemaps.org/guides/places/), such as schools, businesses, hospitals, religious organizations, landmarks, and mountain peak, while the Objects table holds the locations of flights. The goal is to find which flights are closest to each place, which can be crucial for making real-time decisions in air traffic management and ensuring flight safety."
